# Infinite whiteboard template

## About
This is a template for an infinite whiteboard that uses a ```<canvas>``` element.
An example site that has built on this code (adding collaboration and other features) can be found at [infiniboards.com](https://infiniboards.com).

## Accessing the whiteboard
You can open ```index.html``` to use the whiteboard in desktop mode, or run the ```Node.js``` server with:

node app.js
```
